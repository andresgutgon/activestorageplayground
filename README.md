# README
This repo is to learn about
- [ ] ActiveStorage
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Mailer styling with Tailwind

## TODO ActiveStorage
- [] Read the docs
- [] Do an upload your avatar UI
- [] Deploy to Heroku and host assets on S3 or similar

## TODO Authentication
Devise is the fastest way of get up and running. But it would be nice to have a basic setup
with all auth mambo jambo with plain [Rails securepassword](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_model_basics.html#securepassword).
- [] Follow [this article](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-setup-user-authentication-from-scratch-with-rails-6/)
     and their [code here](https://github.com/Njunu-sk/Rails-Authentication)

## TODO Mailer styles
Try to use [maizzle.com/](https://maizzle.com/). Maizzle is a framework that helps you quickly build HTML emails with
Tailwind CSS and advanced, email-specific post-processing.
- [ ] Integrate with Rails. [Looks possible](https://github.com/maizzle/framework/issues/346)
